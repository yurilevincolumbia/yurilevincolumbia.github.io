<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Broad-band QND using optical filters</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">It has been known since the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.23.1693">seminal work</a> of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_M._Caves">Carlton Caves</a>, that 
  squeezed states of light can be used to enhance precision of optical interferometry. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._G._Unruh">Bill Unruh</a>
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279391935_Quantum_Noise_in_the_Interferometer_Detector">realized</a> 
    that one can also use it to beat the Standard Quantum Limit in gravitational-wave interferometers,
  and several versions of his idea were further developed before the end of the last millenium. However, one serious issue was 
  that these ideas were only applicable in the narrow range of frequencies, because of the strong frequency dependence
  of the mechanical impedance of the free test mass.</p>

  <p style="color:Tomato;">At the end of 1990s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> became concerned that no practical scheme existed for the Quantum Nondemolition (QND) 
    measurement in LIGO (QND in the contect of 
  LIGO means simply beating the Standard Quantum Limit). Kip and I travelled to Moscow, where extensive discussions with 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Braginsky">Vladimir Braginsky</a>, Misha Gorodetsky, 
    Khalili, and Vyatchanin took place. Upon returning to Caltech, Kip started a study group, which met regularly once a week to discuss 
  various quantum issues of potential relevance to LIGO; it was well-attended by local Caltech officionados of quantum measurements. During one
  of the meetings, I was reporting on Unruh's ideas and explained the difficulties for applying them to broadband measurements. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Jeff_Kimble">Jeff Kimble</a> 
  immediately had an idea about input optical filters. Kip, together with <a
  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrey-matsko-69a02415/">Andrei Matsko</a> and Sergei Vyatchanin,  performed detailed computations.
  This was the birth of KLMTV:</p>
