<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Broad-band QND using optical filters</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">It has been known since the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.23.1693">seminal work</a> of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_M._Caves">Carlton Caves</a>, that 
  squeezed states of light can be used to enhance precision of optical interferometry. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._G._Unruh">Bill Unruh</a>
  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279391935_Quantum_Noise_in_the_Interferometer_Detector">realized</a> 
    that one can also use it to beat the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) in gravitational-wave interferometers,
  and several versions of his idea were further developed before the end of the last millenium. However, one serious issue was 
  that these ideas were only applicable in the narrow range of frequencies, because of the strong frequency dependence
  of the mechanical impedance of the free test mass.</p>

  <p style="color:Tomato;">At the end of 1990s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kip_Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> became concerned that no practical scheme existed for the Quantum Nondemolition (QND) 
    measurement in LIGO (QND in the contect of 
  LIGO means simply beating the Standard Quantum Limit). I was at the time Kip's PhD studnet, and I spent 
    part of my PhD trying rather fruitlessly to come up with such scheme. There was also a group in Moscow led by 
    Kip's old friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Braginsky">Vladimir Braginsky</a>, the originator of the concepts of
    SQL and QND. Despite of the nearly-complete destruction of Soviet Physics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Braginsky managed
    to retain some talented young people who carried out interesting research. Part of the group's research funding came from Caltech and NSF, 
    and Kip 
    was instrumental in securing it.
    
    In 1998, Kip and I travelled to Moscow, where extensive discussions with 
    Vladimir Braginsky, Misha Gorodetsky, 
    Farid Khalili, and Sergei Vyatchanin took place. Upon returning to Caltech, Kip started a study group, which met regularly once a week to discuss 
  various quantum issues of potential relevance to LIGO; it was well-attended by local Caltech officionados of quantum measurements. During one
  of the meetings, I was reporting on Unruh's ideas and explained the difficulties for applying them to broadband measurements. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Jeff_Kimble">Jeff Kimble</a> 
  immediately had an idea about input optical filters. Kip, together with <a
  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrey-matsko-69a02415/">Andrei Matsko</a> and Sergei Vyatchanin,  performed detailed computations.
  This was the birth of KLMTV:</p>

   Conversion of conventional gravitational-wave interferometers into quantum nondemolition interferometers by modifying their input and/or output optics
  </a></p>

  <p style="color:Tomato;">The input optical filters have now been built and are being tested in Advanced LIGO. They will allow us to make
    larger part of the Universe "visible" to LIGO, and will increase the number of events observed by the gravitational-wave astronomers.
