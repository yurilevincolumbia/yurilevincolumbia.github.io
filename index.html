  <p style="color:Tomato;">Astrophysics is a huge field. It studies the smallest and the largest objects in the Universe and everything in between. Like many theoretical 
    astrophysicists, I work on a number of different, sometimes overlapping topics. This website is an attempt to give an overview of my research and 
    my scientific trajetory</p>
