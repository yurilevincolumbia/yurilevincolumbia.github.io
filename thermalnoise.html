<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Thermal noise</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">During my PhD, I developed a direct approach to calculating thermo-mechanical 
    noise in LIGO interferometers:</p>

Internal thermal noise in the LIGO test masses: A direct approach</a></p>

  <p style="color:Tomato;">The method is computationally cheap, has significant conceptual advantages, and is widely used inside and 
    outside LIGO community. I pointed out that coatings might be
  the source of noise that people could have missed. This turned out indeed to be the case, and the coating thermal noise is among
    the dominant sources
    of noise in many optomechanical experiments. Research on how to reduce it is an 
  active field in precision measurements.</p>

<p style="color:tomato;text-align:center;"> I have also developed a simple method to compute thermo-refractive noise; this is increasingly 
  being used in a number of photonics applications, as devices become increasingly thermal-noise limited:</p>

">Fluctuationâ€“dissipation theorem for thermo-refractive noise</a></p>

 <p style="color:Blue;text-align:center;"> One of the first applications of this formalism was to compute thermo-refractive noise in the beamsplitter 
   of GEO600 gravitational-wave interferometer (at the time, there were questions whether the "mystery noise" had thermo-refractive origin). This was 
   the masters thesis project of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruin-benthem-41323040/?originalSubdomain=nl">Bruin Benthem:</a></p>
