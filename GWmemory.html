<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Gravitational-wave memory</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">Gravitational-wave memory is a permanent distortion of space-time that accompanies explosive events in astrophysics. 
    It is particularly strong if a significant part of the system's rest-mass is anisotropically emitted as relativistic radiation. The only knwown 
 situation where the memory is potentially detectable, is a merger of two black holes, during which several percent of their rest mass leaves the system 
    anisotropically. 
    <a href="https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=favatam">Mark Favata</a> in 2009 showed that the 
    memory will likely be detactable by 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna">LISA</a>. I worked on exploring other options, i.e. 
    GW the memory detetion by Pulsar Timing Arrays (work with 
    <a href="https://www.aei.mpg.de/person/23824/2784"> Rutger van Haasteren </a>) and 
      by LIGO (with

    <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~yanbei/">Yanbei Chen</a>). The predictions are not as promising as those for LISA, but present
    a considerable methodological interest. Hence the considerable number of citations to the papers below:
