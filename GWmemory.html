<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Gravitational-wave memory</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">Gravitational-wave memory is a permanent distortion of space-time that accompanies explosive events in astrophysics. 
    It is particularly strong if a significant part of the system's rest-mass is anisotropically emitted as relativistic radiation. The only knwown 
 situation where the memory is potentially detectable, is a merger of two black holes, during which several percent of their rest mass leaves the system 
    anisotropically. 
    <a href="https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=favatam">Mark Favata</a> in 2009 showed that the 
    memory will likely be detactable by 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna">LISA</a>. I worked on exploring other options, i.e. 
    GW the memory detetion by Pulsar Timing Arrays (work with 
    <a href="https://www.aei.mpg.de/person/23824/2784"> Rutger van Haasteren </a>) and 
      by LIGO (with 
    <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/paul-lasky">Paul Lasky</a>, 
    <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~erict/">Eric Thrane</a>,
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-blackman-06b1177a/"> Jonathan Blackman</a>, and 
    <a href="http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~yanbei/">Yanbei Chen</a>). The predictions are not as promising as those for LISA, but present
    a considerable methodological interest. Hence the considerable number of citations to the papers below:

  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.401.2372V/abstract?bbbRedirect=1"> Gravitational-wave memory and pulsar timing arrays.</a>  This paper 
  argues that the memomry from mergers of supermassive black holes is in principle detectable by PTAs, however the expected rate is very small (perhaps one will
  need to time pulsars for several generations before this will be possible). Similar work was simultaneously and independently done by 
    <a href="">Pshirkov, Baskaran, and Postnov</a> and by <a href="">Seto</a>. <br>
    The methodological interest in our paper is that it presents, for the first time, the time-domain Wiener-Filter formalism as 
  applied to PTAs. The peculiarity of this situation is that one needs to deal with the corrections to the pulsar timing residuals due to variations 
    in the pulsar timing-model parameters. </p>

    Detecting Gravitational-Wave Memory with LIGO: Implications of GW150914.</a>  This paper 
  argues that the memomry from mergers of stellar-mass black holes is potentially detectable by LIGO. However, the memory signal from a sinlge merger is
     too weak to be detectable, and
     one needs collective evidence from many strong mergers to prove the existence of memory. Like with PTAs, one needs a lot of time
     and patience. Therefore my personal bet is
     that LISA will be the first instrument to see Gravitational-Wave memory, despite its planned launch in the now-distant 2034.
