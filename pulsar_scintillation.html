  <p style="color:Tomato;">Scintillations (i.e., "twinkling") of pulsars has a particular radio-frequency and time dependence. The discovery of 
  parabolic arcs by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...549L..97S/abstract">Dan Stinebring et al. (2001)</a> in the doubly-Fourier-transformed spectrum was a watershed event in this field.
    One of the implications was that  the radio-wave scattering responsible for scintillations was concentrated in a series of thin screens 
  along the line of site, as opposed to being more broadly distributed. Observations of 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...708..232B/abstract"> Brisken et al. (2010)</a> showed that at least in some cases
  the scattering is strongly anizotropic. In the context of these considerations, Ue-Li Pen and I proposed a model which involved currugated edge-on 
  reconnection sheets as scattering screens. The overall idea was not  new - 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...640L.159G/abstract">Goldreich & Sridhar (2006)</a>
      already suggested that edge-on sheets 
  could be important for scattering of the radio source SgrA* (physically the latter is due to the accretion disc/jet(?) around the supermassive black hole 
  in the Galactic Center). Moreover, in quite an old paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987Natur.328..324R/abstract">Romani, Blandford, and 
                                                             Cordes (1978)</a>, already considered edge-on planar 
                                                             structures as a possible source of scintillations.
  What was new in our work was the (somewhat trivial) realization that the corrugations of the reconnection sheet 
  naturally produce scattering centers and caustics, and that no major density perturbation along the sheet was
  required.</p>
