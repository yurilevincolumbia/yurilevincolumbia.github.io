  <p style="color:Tomato;">Vibrational modes of the Earth and the Sun are routinely measured and provide a wealth of information about their
  internal structure. Observing a vibrational mode of a neutron star woud provide information about its interiors, and
    this is one of the holy grails of neutron star astrophysics. I have worked on the theory of two types of vibrational modes.
    
    <p style="color:Tomato;">The r-modes were first descussed in Section 3 of 
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978MNRAS.182..423P/abstract">
    this paper by Papaloizou and Pringle.</a> The restoring ingredients for these modes comes mainly from the Coriolis force. Twenty years later, 
    <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wy7j9/professor-nils-andersson">Nils Andersson</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...502..708A/abstract">
      realized</a> that, because of their coupling
    to gravitational radiation, the r-modes in rapidly rotating neutron stars could be unstable to the 
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApJ...222..281F/abstract">Chadrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability</a>. Almost immediately,
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PhRvL..80.4843L/abstract">Lee Lindblom, Ben Owen, and Sharon Morsink</a> showed that
        the main coupling to gravitational radiation was via the magnetic quadrupole moment, and the growth of the modes could be quite rapid.
        This was shortly confirmed by an independent calculation of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...510..846A/abstract">
          Andersson, Kokkotas and Schutz</a>. The r-mode craze was on!
      I was at Caltech and learned about <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/People/Faculty/bio_owen/bio_owen.php">Ben Owen's</a> results 
      early; he was a fellow PhD student in Kip's group
      at the same time (as an aside, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_F._Schutz">Bernard Schutz</a> 
      was Kip's PhD  student many years previously, and the term "CFS instability" is of Kip's
      coinage). I also TA'd <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/e-s-sterl-phinney">Sterl Phinney's</a> astrophysics class and 
      I knew from him that
      the heat capacity of neutron stars was very, very low. Thus thermal effects in the r-mode evolution could be very important.
      The idea for the r-mode driven thermal-runaway cycle in accreting neutron star systems was borne almost instantly, but it took me 
      over 1/2 year to write up these results. Kip helped a lot to clean up my writing, without taking any 
      credit for its contents. This was my first paper in main-stream astrophysics:</p>

     by R-Modes of Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries</a> </p>
 <p style="color:tomato;"> One day after this paper was posted on the arxiv, an <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...341L...1S/abstract"> 
    independent study</a> with similar idea was posted by 
    <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/44080/2377">Henk Spruit.</a> Henk was not focused on the cyclic
  spin evolution or existence of
  stable points in the temperature-spin plane. Instead he was thinking that the r-mode runaway could lead to
  the field buoyancy and ultimately lead to a gamma-ray burst. </p>
