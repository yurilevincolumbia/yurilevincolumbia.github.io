  <p style="color:Tomato;">Vibrational modes of the Earth and the Sun are routinely measured and provide a wealth of information about their
  internal structure. Observing a vibrational mode of a neutron star woud provide information about its interiors, and
    this is one of the holy grails of neutron star astrophysics. I have worked on the theory of two types of vibrational modes.
    
    <p style="color:Tomato;">1. The r-modes were first descussed in Section 3 of 
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978MNRAS.182..423P/abstract">
    this paper by Papaloizou and Pringle.</a> The restoring ingredient for these modes comes mainly from the Coriolis force. Twenty years later, 
    <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wy7j9/professor-nils-andersson">Nils Andersson</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...502..708A/abstract">
      realized</a> that, because of their coupling
    to gravitational radiation, the r-modes in rapidly rotating neutron stars could be unstable to the 
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApJ...222..281F/abstract">Chadrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability</a>. Almost immediately,
      <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998PhRvL..80.4843L/abstract">Lee Lindblom, Ben Owen, and Sharon Morsink</a> showed that
        the main coupling to gravitational radiation was via the magnetic quadrupole moment, and the growth of the modes could be quite rapid.
        This was shortly confirmed by an independent calculation of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...510..846A/abstract">
          Nils Andersson, Kostas Kokkotas and Bernard Schutz</a>. The r-mode craze was on!
      I was at Caltech and learned about <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/People/Faculty/bio_owen/bio_owen.php">Ben Owen's</a> results 
      early; he was a fellow PhD student in Kip's group
      at the same time (as an aside, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_F._Schutz">Bernard Schutz</a> 
      was Kip's PhD  student many years previously, and the term "CFS instability" is of Kip's
      coinage). I also TA'd <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/e-s-sterl-phinney">Sterl Phinney's</a> astrophysics class and 
      I knew from him that
      the heat capacity of neutron stars was very, very low. Thus thermal effects in the r-mode evolution could be very important.
      The idea for the r-mode driven thermal-runaway cycle in accreting neutron star systems was borne almost instantly, but it took me 
      over 1/2 year to write up these results. Kip helped a lot to clean up my writing, without taking any 
      credit for its contents. This was my first paper in main-stream astrophysics:</p>
      <p stype="color:Blue;text-align:center;">
   <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...517..328L/abstract"> Runaway Heating 
     by R-Modes of Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries</a> </p>
 <p style="color:tomato;"> One day after this paper was posted on the arxiv, an <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...341L...1S/abstract"> 
    independent study</a> with similar idea was posted by 
    <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/person/44080/2377">Henk Spruit.</a> Henk was not focused on the cyclic
  spin evolution or existence of
  stable points in the temperature-spin plane. Instead he was thinking that the r-mode runaway could lead to
  the field buoyancy and ultimately lead to a gamma-ray burst. </p>

        Hundreds(?) of papers have been written on r-mode instability in neutron stars since, but its astrophysical significance is not
    totally clear (and in fact the large number of papers is not helping). Importantly, in a series of studies (e.g., 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PhRvD..65b4001S/abstract">Shenk et al. (2001),</a> 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...591.1129A/abstract">Arras et al. (2003), </a>
    <a href=-"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PhRvD..70l1501B/abstract">Brink et al. (2004),</a>
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007PhRvD..76f4019B/abstract"> Bondarescu et al. (2007),</a> contributing major parts to the
    theses of 4 PhD students) 
    a group at Cornell showed that the r-modes are likely to saturate at very small amplitudes. A caveat for these
    calculations is that all of them assumed a perfectly fluid star, while real neutron stars have crusts (more about this below).
    However, my intuition tells me that the overall results are likely to hold up for stars with crusts as well. These findings imply that (a) 
  r-mode instability does not have any impact on young, rapidly cooling stars as envisaged in all original papers (b) the instability
  in accreting neutron stars was acting slowly, leading to at best slow runaway cycles and certainly no gamma-ray bursts. Whether the
  instability could potentially limit the spins of accreting neutron stars in Low-Mass X-ray Binaries and be responsible for
  setting the spins of millisecond pulsars depends on the details of the rmodes linear damping.</p>

  <p style="color:tomato">The r-mode damping depends on dissipative processes in neutron-star interiors. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...529L..33B/abstract"
    Lars Bildsten and Greg Ushomirsky</a>
    that the oscillating viscous linear  boundary layer between the crust and the fluid core may be crucial for providing the damping
    that stabilizes the r-modes. However, their calculations assumed that the crust was perfectly rigid. 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-ushomirsky-a87a00/">Greg Ushomirsky</a> and I
    showed that the latter assumption is incorrect, and that the crust takes part in the r-mode motion. As a result of this,
    the viscous damping rate in
    the boundary layer depends very sensitively on the crust's radial structure.
