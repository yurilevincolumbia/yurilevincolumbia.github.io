<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Type-I X-ray bursts</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">Some of the bright x-ray sources in the sky are neutron stars that are accreting gas from  
  much larger companions. The gas, consisting of Hydrogen and Helium, accumulates in an ocean that covers the surface. As acretion proceeds,
    the ocean becomes more massive and the Hydrogen and Helium at the base of the ocean become incresingly compressed. 
    Once the density at the base
  reaches about 1 million gramms per cubic centimeter (roughly the same as the density at the center of a white dwarf), the ocean ignites and 
  burns up. This produces a brillian flare in x-rays and other bands, known as "Type-I x-ray burst". Type-I x-ray bursts are routinely observed.</p>

  <p style="color:Tomato;"> The rises of the bursts are typically quite short, less than a second. This means that the nuclear flames, 
    once ignited at some spot on a netron star surface, propagate around the neutron star on a timescale less than a second. The flame speeds should be
    impressively high, between 10 and 100 km/sec! Together with <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~anatoly/">Anatoly Spitkovsky</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-ushomirsky-a87a00/">Greg Ushomirsky</a>, I made a crack at understanding such high flame 
    speeds and their geometry in 2001-2. Anatoly was a PhD student at Berkeley, working on pic simulations that would one day make him famous 
    in the Astrophysics world. 
    He nonetheless found the time to take a lead on this projet. We worked on it closely for about a year. None of us knew any geophysical fluid dynamics,
    but we had to learn it rather well to address this problem. The strongly accreting neutron stars are incredibly fast rotators, 
    and the Coriolis force plays a huge role. The flames are essentially nulear hurricanes!

  The SLU paper only used two vertial zones, and left many unanswered questions about the details. Many of these were adressed 
  in <a href="http://www.astroscu.unam.mx/IA/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1009&Itemid=88&lang=es">Yuri Cavecchi's</a> PhD thesis 
  whih was co-supervised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.l.watts/">Anna Watts</a> and myself. The real engine for this research was the 
  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427.3265B/abstract">magneto-hydrodynamical code</a>
  that was developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-braithwaite-0276771a/?originalSubdomain=de">
    Jonathan (Jon) Braithwaite</a>. This code enforced hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, thus avoiding unnecessary and
  costly tracking of vertical sound waves. This allowed Yuri to carry out vertical multizone simulations of 
  propagating flames that clarified many aspects of
  this process.
