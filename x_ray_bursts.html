<h1 style="color:Violet;text-align:center;">Type-I X-ray bursts</h1>
  <p style="color:Tomato;">Some ob the bright sources of x-rays in the sky are neutron stars that are accreting gas from a 
  much larger companion. The gas, consisting of H and He, accumulates in an ocean that covers the surface. As acretion proceeds,
    the ocean becomes more massive and the hydrogen and helium at the base of the ocean become incresingly compressed. 
    Once the density at the base
  reaches about 1 million gramms per cubic centimeter (roughly the same as the density at the center of a white dwarf), the ocean ignites and 
  burns up; this produces a brillian flare in x-rays and other bands, known as "Type-I -ray burst". These bursts are commonly observed from such sources,
  with the wealth of detailed information.</p>
